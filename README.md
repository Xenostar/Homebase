# The Homebase Framework
The Homebase Framework is a responsive SCSS/JS/HTML template boostrap designed to quickly get pages started. The core concept here is simplicity: You will not find pre-made menus or navigation, headers or footers. This framework is simply meant to provide a clean, blank slate to start your application with.

## Notes
You will need to run `npm install` and then run `grun watch` to compile your source files into the `/assets` folder.
