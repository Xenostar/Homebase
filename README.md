# The Homebase Framework
======

The Homebase Framework is a responsive SCSS, JS, and HTML template boostrap designed to quickly get pages started. The focus of this framework is to provide a clean template to craft responsive web pages quickly and efficiently. The core concept here is simplicity: you will not find pre-made menus or navigations, headers or footers. This framework is simply meant to provide a clean, blank slate to start your application with.
