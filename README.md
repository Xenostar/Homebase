# The Homebase Framework
The Xenostar Studios Homebase Framework is a responsive SCSS/JS/HTML template bootstrap designed to quickly get web apps started. The core concept here is simplicity: You will not find pre-made menus or navigation, headers or footers. This framework is simply meant to provide a clean, blank slate to start your application with.

## Notes
You will need to run `npm install` to downlod dependencies. Then, you can run `grunt watch` before editing files in `/source`. These will then be compiled automatically into your `/assets` folder for linking to views.

## Requirements
Coming soon.
